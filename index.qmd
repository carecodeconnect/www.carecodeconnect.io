Welcome to our portfolio! ü§ó

**Social Data Science** combines the tools of social science and data science to build solutions to complex social problems.

1. **We decode the matrix of human relations with technology**: by linking computation with interpretation, we tell the human stories behind the data.

2. **We build machine learning solutions to create caring futures**: a data revolution that is equitable, fair, and sustainable. Our solutions are infused with care, ethics, privacy. We are sensitive to cultural, geographical, historical circumstances, social contexts and differences that make a difference.

3. **We use cutting-edge free and open source technologies to put people at the heart of the data**. We inform evidence-based decision-making and actionable 'outsights' to make the world a better place.

In short, we **care**, **code**, **connect**.
