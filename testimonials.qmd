# *Dr. Meg-John Barker*, writer, mentor and associate at *Centre for Transforming Sexuality and Gender*, University of Brighton

> "I consider Stephen to be an exceptional researcher who would be an asset to any organisation. I have known Stephen for over a decade as a friend and colleague. I consider their work to be some of the most important and innovative in the field, and I frequently draw upon it in my own writing. We have also collaborated together on a number of projects. We have conducted and published research together, as well as co-organising several conferences and other events. Most recently, I was a stakeholder/participant on their major funded project: ‘Mapping Mindfulness’. I can therefore speak to Stephen’s abilities, professionalism, communication skills, and qualities as a researcher and colleague. The ‘Mapping Mindfulness’ project employed an innovative participatory co-design, which meant that stakeholder/participants were engaged with in various ways throughout the research process. I certainly found that this approach enabled me to feel invested in the project, with the potential to engage in ways that ensured that the outcomes of the research would be helpful in relation to my own work. In all of their research, Stephen demonstrates clear, enthusiastic and insightful engagement with their stakeholders and participants, and a consistent commitment to ethical principles." 

# *Duncan Moss*, Clinical Psychologist & Researcher

> "I am a Clinical Psychologist and Researcher with over 30 years experience and have known Stephen for over 10 years. In that time we have collaborated (and I have participated) on a number of projects and I have come to know their abilities very well. Stephen is an extremely capable Researcher with a mastery of a wide range of research skills. In my experience, they are able to work with both data and people very capably. Stephen has a particular ability at synthesising wide ranging data - quantitative and qualitative - and putting these into a clear and coherent context. Their writing skills are extremely advanced in my opinion. I’ve also witnessed Stephen working closely with colleagues and participants, for example creatively organising, hosting and facilitating events with a wide range of people involved. Stephen's calm, mindful and friendly demeanour and quiet leadership is always evident. I have no hesitation in recommending them as a fantastic asset to any organisation."
