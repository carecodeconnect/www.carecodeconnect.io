The MapMind project studied the people at the forefront of the mindfulness movement. We studied the popularity, nature, teaching, and societal influence of mindfulness. We focused on the people, places, and practices within the mindfulness movement, especially teachers. The project provides insights into the untold stories and hidden histories of the people leading the mindfulness phenomenon. A central aim of the project is to enhance the accessibility and impact of mindfulness teaching in the U.K.

I was **Principal Investigator** on the project and led a core team of 4 researchers over 4 years (2017-2021). We received **£227,661** of funding from an independent funding body, [The Leverhulme Trust](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/). The project included the first nationwide survey of mindfulness teachers worldwide, and involved participation of **800+** users, and **60+** stakeholder organizations, networks and centres.

In this report, I focus on the following specific research question: **where** is mindfulness being taught?

The analysis in this report utilized the machine learning algorithm of **K-Means clustering** to explore the urban concentrations of mindfulness teaching, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling large geospatial datasets.

This document is interactive, which means you can interact with the maps, by zooming in and out, or selecting the layers to view.

## Key 'Outsights'

Part I of the MapMind project showcases the following:

1. **Business Relevance**: MapMind provides essential data-driven insights for mindfulness businesses in the wellness and health sectors, as well as educational and mental health institutions. It enables these entities to pinpoint areas for mindfulness program implementation, understand regional preferences, and customize their services. The project also aids policymakers in appreciating the role of mindfulness in mental health and wellbeing, guiding funding and support decisions.

2. **Technical Skills**: The project demonstrates advanced technical skills, employing Python and related libraries for data collection, analysis, and GIS mapping. These technical aspects highlight the project's robust foundation in modern data science practices, making it a notable example of how programming and analytical skills can be applied to socially significant issues.

# Problem Statement

Mindfulness - a mind-body practice to enhance awareness of the present moment - has become a global phenomenon, even a movement or revolution. Mindfulness meditation is impacting a wide array of fields, from health and well-being to education, business to politics, science to technology. A recent survey suggests 15% of adults in Britain - almost 8 million people - have learnt how to practice mindfulness meditation (Simonsson *et al.*, 2021). Yet, despite the remarkable rise and popularity of mindfulness, and the many studies of its therapeutic effectiveness (see figure 1), studies of the movement's spread and significance are few.

# Mapping Mapping Teacher Locations

We gathered data to map the locations of both mindfulness teachers and mindfulness teaching in our sample. The locations of mindfulness teachers were mapped using two types of data recorded by the survey software `Qualtrics`. I used this data in the following ways:

- **IP addresses**: To geolocate the IP addresses, I created a function `geolocate_ip`. This called the API at `ip-api.com` with an IP address and returned latitude and longitude coordinates. I needed to leave a delay of 1.5 seconds between requests. It took 20 minutes to geolocate 768 IP addresses. 

I saved the dataset as a pickle (`.pkl`) file. Using a pickle file for saving a pandas DataFrame, particularly one derived from an SPSS `.sav` file, offers significant advantages over a `CSV` file. It ensures the preservation of original data types, including complex structures and handling of missing data (like `NaN` or `pd.NA` values), which are crucial for datasets from SPSS. Pickle format also maintains the DataFrame's index and column structure accurately.

- **Data cleaning**: I cleaned the survey dataset by converting blank entries to NA ("not available" in `pandas`) and filtering out NAs. 

- **Latitude and longitude coordinates** were available for 640 participants (127 coordinates were not available (NA)).

I used `folium` to map the locations of mindfulness teachers and mindfulness teaching. 

This is an interactive map. To interact with the map, click on the `+` and `-` buttons to zoom in and out. To display where mindfulness teachers are located, and where mindfulness teaching takes place, click the buttons on the top left. This gives different perspectives on the data.

The map shows that mindfulness teachers are located widely across the U.K. 

```{python}
# Load data
survey = pd.read_spss("data/mm_survey_recoded-all-main_SPSS.sav")
survey_with_geo = pd.read_pickle('data/survey_with_geolocation.pkl')

# Clean and prepare data
survey['LocationLatitude'] = pd.to_numeric(survey['LocationLatitude'], errors='coerce')
survey['LocationLongitude'] = pd.to_numeric(survey['LocationLongitude'], errors='coerce')
survey.dropna(subset=['LocationLatitude', 'LocationLongitude'], inplace=True)

# Create a map object centered on a default location
map_teacher_locations = folium.Map(location=[54.7, -3.4], zoom_start=5)

# Define strong shades of blue
teacher_color = "#0000FF"  # Strong standard blue
ip_color = "#0033CC"  # Darker shade of blue

# Add layer for coordinates from .sav file
teacher_locations_layer = folium.FeatureGroup(name="Teacher Locations (Coordinates)")
for _, row in survey.iterrows():
    folium.CircleMarker(
        location=[row['LocationLatitude'], row['LocationLongitude']],
        radius=3,  # Slightly larger radius
        color=teacher_color,
        fill=True,
        fill_color=teacher_color,
        fill_opacity=0.6,  # Less opaque
        weight=0.5  # Thinner boundary
    ).add_to(teacher_locations_layer)
teacher_locations_layer.add_to(map_teacher_locations)

# Add layer for IP coordinates
ip_locations_layer = folium.FeatureGroup(name="Teacher Locations (IP)")
for _, row in survey_with_geo.iterrows():
    if pd.notna(row['ip_lat']) and pd.notna(row['ip_long']):
        folium.CircleMarker(
            location=[row['ip_lat'], row['ip_long']],
            radius=3,  # Slightly larger radius

            fill=True,
            fill_color=ip_color,
            fill_opacity=0.6,  # Less opaque
            weight=0.5  # Thinner boundary
        ).add_to(ip_locations_layer)
ip_locations_layer.add_to(map_teacher_locations)

# Add Layer Control to switch between layers
folium.LayerControl().add_to(map_teacher_locations)

# Save the map to an HTML file
map_teacher_locations.save('results/map_teacher_locations.html')

# Display the map

```

## Mapping Mindfulness Training Providers

We asked our participants which recognised provider they received their main training to teach mindfulness.

This code performs data manipulation and visualization to analyze mindfulness training providers. Using `Pandas` for data handling, it loads, renames, and filters a dataset, focusing on the `training_providers` column. Key data manipulations include replacing specific entries and filtering out irrelevant data. `Matplotlib` is then used to plot the frequency of each provider in a horizontal bar chart. The results indicate that the top three mindfulness training providers are 'Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, Bangor University' (135 instances), 'Breathworks' (96 instances), and 'Mindfulness Association' (40 instances), showcasing their prevalence in the dataset.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the modified DataFrame
survey = pd.read_pickle('data/tidied_survey.pkl')

# Rename the column
survey.rename(columns={'R2.4_9': 'training_providers'}, inplace=True)

# Select the renamed column
training_providers = survey['training_providers']

# Rename 'Bangor' to 'Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, Bangor University'
training_providers = training_providers.replace('Bangor', 'Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, Bangor University')

# Filter out NAs (empty strings)
training_providers = training_providers[training_providers != '']

# Calculate frequency counts
frequency_counts = training_providers.value_counts()

# Remove entries with 0 frequency (this will exclude 'Not applicable' and 'Other' if they have 0 counts)
frequency_counts = frequency_counts[frequency_counts > 0]

# Plot the frequencies with switched axes
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
frequency_counts.plot(kind='barh')  # 'barh' for horizontal bar plot
plt.title('Frequency of Mindfulness Training Providers')
plt.ylabel('Training Provider')
plt.xlabel('Frequency')
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()  # Invert y-axis to have the highest frequency on top
plt.show()

```

This code integrates data processing, geocoding, and mapping to visualize the distribution of mindfulness training providers. The code processes data from a DataFrame, calculating the frequency of each training provider. It maps provider names to addresses and uses regular expressions to extract UK postcodes. For geolocating these postcodes, the script utilizes the `api.postcodes.io` service, fetching latitude and longitude data for each U.K. postcode. `Folium` is then used to plot these locations on a map, with circle markers whose sizes correspond to the frequency of each provider. The UMass Centre for Mindfulness is given special treatment with predefined coordinates. Finally, the script generates an interactive heatmap, illustrating the geographical spread and prevalence of mindfulness training centers across various locations.

survey.rename(columns={'R2.4_9': 'training_providers'}, inplace=True)
training_providers = survey['training_providers']
training_providers = training_providers.replace('Bangor', 'Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, Bangor University')
training_providers = training_providers[training_providers != '']
training_providers = training_providers[~training_providers.isin(['Not applicable', 'Other'])]

# Calculate frequency counts
frequency_counts = training_providers.value_counts()

# Print the frequency table for verification

## Mapping Retreat Centres

We asked our participants which retreat centres or affiliates they had visited. Our data comprised frequency counts of the participants who had visited the following centres. I processed and analysed the survey data related to retreat centers using the `pandas` library. I loaded the survey DataFrame from a pickled file and transformed it into a long format, specifically targeting columns associated with retreat centers. The script then filters out entries without visited retreat centers and replaces coded names with actual names using a predefined dictionary. Further, it cleans the data by renaming a column and treating empty strings as missing values. Additionally, the script performs a basic text analysis by counting specific keywords in a text column. Finally, it aggregates this count data with the frequency data of retreat centers into a single table, sorts it, and displays the results.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.graph_objs as go

# Load the modified DataFrame
survey = pd.read_pickle('data/tidied_survey.pkl')

# Melt the DataFrame to long format and filter out non-visited retreat centres
melted_survey = survey.melt(value_vars=['Q4.5_1', 'Q4.5_2', 'Q4.5_3', 'Q4.5_4', 'Q4.5_5',
                                        'Q4.5_6', 'Q4.5_7', 'Q4.5_8'],
                            var_name='retreat_centre_variable', value_name='retreat_centre')
melted_survey = melted_survey[melted_survey['retreat_centre'].notna() & (melted_survey['retreat_centre'] != 0)]

# Mapping for retreat centre names and replace variable names with actual names
retreat_centre_names = {
    'Q4.5_1': 'Amaravati Retreat Centre', 'Q4.5_2': 'Gaia House', 'Q4.5_3': 'Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre',
    'Q4.5_4': 'Trigonos', 'Q4.5_5': 'Triratna Buddhist Community', 'Q4.5_6': 'Tibetan Buddhist Centre',
    'Q4.5_7': 'Vipassana Trust, Dhamma Dīpa', 'Q4.5_8': 'Western Chan Fellowship'
}
melted_survey['retreat_centres'] = melted_survey['retreat_centre_variable'].map(retreat_centre_names)
frequency_table = melted_survey['retreat_centres'].value_counts()

# Rename and convert empty strings to pd.NA in the original survey
survey = survey.rename(columns={'Q4.5_9_TEXT': 'retreat_centres_others'})
survey['retreat_centres_others'] = survey['retreat_centres_others'].replace('', pd.NA)

# Count occurrences of specific words or phrases
keywords = ['Samye Ling', 'Holy Isle', 'Plum Village', 'Mindfulness Association',
            'Community of Interbeing', 'Tara Rokpa Centre', 'Breathworks',
            'Oxford Mindfulness Centre', 'Zenways']
keyword_counts = {keyword: survey['retreat_centres_others'].str.contains(keyword, case=False, na=False).sum() for keyword in keywords}

# Convert keyword counts to a DataFrame and combine with frequency table
keyword_counts_df = pd.DataFrame(list(keyword_counts.items()), columns=['Keyword', 'Occurrences'])
combined_frequency_table = pd.concat([frequency_table, keyword_counts_df.set_index('Keyword')['Occurrences']]).sort_values(ascending=False)

# Create a table with Plotly Express
fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Table(
    header=dict(values=["Retreat Centre", "Frequency"]),
    cells=dict(values=[combined_frequency_table.index, combined_frequency_table.values],
               format=[None, ".0f"])
)])

# Add a title to the table
fig.update_layout(title="Retreat Centres")

# Show the table
fig.show()

```

I then used `pandas`, `folium`, `requests`, `re`, and `geopy` to create an interactive map displaying the locations of the retreat centers in the U.K., along with additional centers with predefined coordinates. 

The `Nominatim` geocoder from `geopy` is initialized to convert addresses into geographic coordinates. A regular expression (regex) is used to extract U.K. postcodes from addresses. The `requests` library is employed to retrieve geolocation data from an external API using these postcodes. 

The `folium` library is utilized to create an interactive map centered on the U.K. The map is populated with circle markers representing the retreat centers. These markers are dynamically sized based on the frequency of each center. The frequency data and the coordinates (either from geocoding or predefined) are used to plot the markers.

Additionally, a feature group is created in `folium` to manage these markers, allowing for interactive control over their display. Finally, the map is saved as an HTML file, enabling easy sharing and viewing.

This code visualises the geographical data in an interactive manner, and its application here for mapping retreat centers based on survey frequency demonstrates a practical use case in data presentation and geographic analysis.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import folium
from folium.plugins import HeatMap
import requests
import re
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim

# Initialize a Geocoder instance for Nominatim
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="geoapiExercises")

# Regex pattern for UK postcodes
postcode_regex = r'\b[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9][A-Z0-9]? ?[0-9][A-Z]{2}\b'

def extract_postcode(address):
    matches = re.findall(postcode_regex, address, re.IGNORECASE)
    if matches:
        return matches[0].replace(" ", "").upper()
    else:
        return None

def get_geolocation(postcode):
    response = requests.get(f"http://api.postcodes.io/postcodes/{postcode}")
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return None

# Initialize the map centered at a specific location
map_retreat_centres = folium.Map(location=[54, -2], zoom_start=6)
layer_group = folium.FeatureGroup(name="Retreat Centres")

# Addresses for the UK centers
uk_addresses = {
    "Amaravati Retreat Centre": "St Margarets, Great Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, HP1 3BZ, England, United Kingdom",

Finally, I combined the two datasets, training centres and retreat centres, and displayed them on a single interactive map using the `Folium` library. The code uses various libraries, including `Pandas` for data manipulation, `Folium` for map visualization, and `Geopy` for geolocation services. The code first loads and cleans the training centre data, calculates the frequency of each training centre, and plots them as red markers on the map, with marker sizes scaled based on their frequency. Similarly, it retrieves and plots retreat centre data as blue markers, both for UK addresses and additional coordinates. The resulting map allows users to explore both training and retreat centres with pop-up information, and it includes a layer control for toggling between the two datasets. Finally, the map is saved as an HTML file for further use.

## Mindfulness Teaching by Nation

We asked our participants which nations they have taught mindfulness. 

The exploratory data analysis involved a dataset focused on mindfulness teaching locations across various regions and areas. The analysis was conducted using `pandas` for data handling, `plotly.express` for interactive visualizations, and `prettytable` for presenting data in a tabular format. The analysis aimed to identify trends and distributions in mindfulness teaching across different nations (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland) and distinguish between urban, rural, and mixed areas.

The findings revealed a significant concentration of mindfulness teaching in England, predominantly in urban areas. Regional analysis within each nation showed variations, with South East England, Greater London, and South West England being prominent in England. In Scotland, Edinburgh and the Lothians, Glasgow and the Clyde, and Southern Scotland were key regions. South East Wales and North West Wales were notable in Wales, while Northern Ireland showed relatively lower activity in mindfulness teaching, with Derry-Londonderry and Down as the main regions.

Later, we present a heatmap which shows clusters of mindfulness teaching in specific urban centres of England, Scotland, and Wales.

## Mapping Mindfulness Teaching 

When asked to report the three most recent locations where they had provided lessons, we found the provision of mindfulness in the U.K. appears to be surprisingly well distributed across both national and geographic settings. 

The geographic spread of mindfulness teaching locations was analysed using an interactive heatmap, generated from a total of `1,076` postcodes provided by `639` participants. 

The first Python code block utilizes the `pandas` and `requests` libraries for data manipulation and HTTP requests, respectively. It loads a DataFrame `survey_with_postcodes` from a pickle file, defines functions to check if a postcode is full and to get its geolocation data using the `postcodes.io` API. The code iterates through the DataFrame, processes only full postcodes, retrieves their geolocation data, and stores this data in new columns (`postcode_1_geo`, `postcode_2_geo`, `postcode_3_geo`). The geolocated count is tracked and printed, and the updated DataFrame is saved as a pickle file. The outcome is a DataFrame enriched with geolocation data for each full postcode, and a total of 1076 postcodes successfully geolocated.

The second code block uses `pandas` for data handling and `folium` (along with its `HeatMap` plugin) for creating interactive maps. It loads two DataFrames from pickle files, representing two different surveys. The script creates a map centered on the UK and generates heat data by extracting geolocation coordinates from both surveys. It then adds this data to a heatmap layer on the map. The script counts and prints the number of non-NA geolocated coordinates from each survey, totaling `1076`. The combined heatmap is saved as an HTML file, providing a visual representation of the postcode data from both surveys.

A limitation of the teaching location heatmaps is that they only show where mindfulness is taught in *Britain*. The `GeoJSON` files for geolocating postcodes only included postcodes in Britain.

# Clustering Mindfulness Teaching

The earlier maps of mindfulness teachers and mindfulness teaching suggested they are uniformly spread across Britain.

However, when viewing the heatmap, I noticed a potential pattern: mindfulness teaching seemed to be clustered in urban centres, i.e. cities, in a way that seemed relatively distinct from mindfulness teaching in suburban or rural areas.

I hypothesised that mindfulness teaching is clustered in urban areas.

To test this hypothesis, I used `K-Means` clustering. `K-Means` clustering is an effective and suitable choice for identifying urban concentrations of mindfulness teaching, thanks to its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability, particularly for large geospatial datasets. `K-Means` is an unsupervised learning algorithm, ideal for exploratory data analysis (EDA) where the goal is to uncover inherent patterns without pre-labeled data. It excels in revealing natural groupings based on spatial proximity, thereby facilitating the understanding of geographical distribution and cluster formation. Additionally, its ability to process numerous locations efficiently and provide easy-to-interpret results makes K-Means particularly well-suited for geospatial analyses aimed at identifying key areas of interest or activity hotspots.

for _, row in survey_with_postcodes_geo.iterrows():
    for col in ['geom_postcode_1', 'geom_postcode_2', 'geom_postcode_3']:

            heat_data.append([row[col].centroid.y, row[col].centroid.x])

# Convert heat_data to a DataFrame

# Using KMeans clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=0).fit(coordinates)

# Assigning cluster labels to the original data
coordinates['cluster'] = kmeans.labels_

# Assuming 'coordinates' DataFrame has the cluster information

The results from the spatial analysis linking K-Means clusters to Local Authority Districts (LADs) can provide interesting insights into the geographical distribution of mindfulness teaching locations in the UK. Let's interpret the results in the context of the clustering data. Here's the summary of the K-Means clusters reordered by frequency, from the largest to the smallest:

1. **Brighton and Hove (Cluster 3)**: The largest cluster with 166 locations, is mostly associated with "Brighton and Hove". This suggests that Brighton and Hove is a significant hub for mindfulness teaching, having the highest concentration of such locations among all the clusters.

2. **Leeds (Cluster 2)**: Comprising 115 locations, this cluster is primarily found in "Leeds". This indicates that Leeds is an important area for mindfulness teaching, with a substantial number of locations within this cluster.

3. **City of Britsol (Cluster 0)**: With 78 locations, this cluster is most commonly associated with "Bristol, City of". It highlights Bristol as a notable center for mindfulness teaching, with a significant number of locations concentrated in this area.

4. **City of Edinburgh (Cluster 1)**: This cluster, including 68 locations, is predominantly in the "City of Edinburgh". This demonstrates that Edinburgh has a considerable concentration of mindfulness teaching locations, marking it as a distinct cluster.

5. **Cardiff (Cluster 4)**: The smallest cluster, consisting of 60 locations, is closely linked to "Cardiff". This indicates that Cardiff, while having fewer locations compared to other clusters, is still a key area for mindfulness teaching within this specific cluster.

This reordered summary presents a clearer picture of the distribution of mindfulness teaching locations across different urban centers in the UK, with a focus on the size of each cluster. It helps in understanding the relative concentration of mindfulness teaching activities in these areas, from the most densely populated cluster to the least.

In relation to the previous clustering (0-4), these results provide a geographical context to the clusters, associating each cluster with a specific urban area or city in the UK. This spatial dimension can be extremely valuable for understanding regional patterns in mindfulness teaching, planning for resource allocation, marketing strategies, or further research into regional differences in mindfulness practice and teaching.

The LADs associated with each cluster seem to reflect major urban centers in different parts of the UK, suggesting that these areas might have higher demands or cultural inclinations towards mindfulness practices. Additionally, this could also be influenced by factors like population density, availability of mindfulness teachers, and regional differences in lifestyle and stress levels.

Understanding these geographical patterns can be beneficial for policymakers, educators, and researchers in the field of mindfulness and mental health. It allows for targeted interventions and resource allocation to optimize the availability and impact of mindfulness teachings across different regions.

## Nation Influences Year Started Teaching

In an analysis using `Pandas`, `PrettyTable`, and the `SciPy` ANOVA function (`f_oneway`), the dataset on mindfulness teaching across various nations was explored. The analysis focused on the `year_started` variable, representing the year in which mindfulness teaching commenced. A `PrettyTable` displayed aggregated data, including mean, median, minimum, maximum years, and counts, sorted by the median `year_started` in ascending order for each nation. 

**ANOVA**, or Analysis of Variance, is a statistical technique used to compare the means of three or more independent groups to determine if there's a statistically significant difference among them. In the given context, ANOVA is applied to compare the average year in which mindfulness teachers began teaching across various nations. The `Statistic` in the ANOVA table, the F-statistic, is a ratio of the variance between group means to the variance within the groups. A high F-statistic suggests a greater difference between the group means relative to the variation within the groups. In these results, the F-statistic is `15.651623486005224`, indicating that the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance is substantial. 

The **p-value** in an ANOVA test helps determine the significance of the results. It's the probability of observing the results if the null hypothesis (which states that there are no differences among group means) is true. A very small p-value, like these results (`2.8012685079689403e-12`), suggests that the null hypothesis can be rejected. This means there's a statistically significant difference in the average year mindfulness teachers started teaching among different nations. The extremely low p-value, much smaller than the standard threshold of `0.05`, indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting that the variation in the start year of mindfulness teaching among the nations is significant and not due to random chance.

The ANOVA test revealed significant differences in the starting years across nations, indicating variability in when mindfulness teaching was initiated in different regions. Key insights include Northern Ireland having the earliest median starting year, contrasted with Wales and Scotland having the latest. The ANOVA test, used for the numeric variable `year_started`, highlights significant differences in the start year of mindfulness teaching across nations. 

These results imply both cultural and systemic differences in mindfulness teaching practices, with certain nations adopting seeing mindfulness teaching earlier or more extensively, and others showing historical trends in the adoption of mindfulness teaching.
